## Scheme
```Scheme
(definec (A234016 n) (if (< n 2) 0 (+ (A234016 (- n 1)) (- 1 (A079559 n)))))
;; Alternatively, based on A046699, with its October 2012 starting offset:
(define (A234016 n) (- n (- (A046699 (+ n 2)) 1)))

## Python
```Python
from sympy import factorial

    s=1
    while factorial(2*s)%(2**(n - 1)): s+=1
    return s
def a(n): return n - (a046699(n + 2) - 1)
