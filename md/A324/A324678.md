# Starting at n, a\(n\) is the minimum negative position from which a spot must be revisited on the next move, or zero if no such positions exist, according to the following rules\. On the k\-th step \(k\=1,2,3,\.\.\.\) move a distance of k in the direction of zero\. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away\.
