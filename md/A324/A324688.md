# Starting at n, a\(n\) is the difference of the number of times we move away from zero from positive spots and the number of times we move away from zero from negative spots according to the following rules\. On the k\-th step \(k\=1,2,3,\.\.\.\) move a distance of k in the direction of zero\. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away\.
