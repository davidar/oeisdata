# Starting at n, a\(n\) is the minimum positive point visited, or zero if no positive points are visited, according to the following rules\. On the k\-th step \(k\=1,2,3,\.\.\.\) move a distance of k in the direction of zero\. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away from zero instead\.
