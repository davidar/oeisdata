# Prime numbers p such that Euclidean distance from origin to p in hexagonal grid sets a new record\. Number '1' is placed at the origin and '2' at \(1, 0\)\. Number 'm' \(m \>\= 3\) is placed by moving one unit forward in the direction from 'm\-2' to 'm\-1', if m \- 1 is not a prime; otherwise, making 1/6 turn counterclockwise at 'm\-1' followed by moving one unit forward\.
