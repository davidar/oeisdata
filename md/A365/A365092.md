# Write out the canonical factorization of n and factorize the exponents in the factorization, the exponents in the factorizations of the exponents, \.\.\. until there are only prime numbers left\. Replace each p in the factorization by \(p\-1\)\+1 and factorize each p\-1 by the same process if p\-1 \> 1\. Continue this process until there are only 1s left\. a\(n\) is the number of 1s used\.
