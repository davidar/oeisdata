# Consider integers k\=0,1,2,\.\.\. as strings\. Compare each digit in the string, in left\-to\-right order, with the contents of a bag \(multiset\) of digits, which is initially empty\. If digit d is in the bag delete d from both the string and the bag\. What remains of any nonempty string is appended to the sequence and its digits are added to the bag\.
