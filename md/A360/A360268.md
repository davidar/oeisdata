# A version of the Josephus problem: a\(n\) is the surviving integer under the following elimination process\. Arrange 1,2,3,\.\.\.,n in a circle, increasing clockwise\. Starting with i\=1, delete the integer 5 places clockwise from i\. Repeat, counting 5 places from the next undeleted integer, until only one integer remains\.
