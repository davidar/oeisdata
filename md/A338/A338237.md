# a\(n\) is the number of nodes with depth of n in a binary tree defined as: root \= 1 and a child \(C\) of a node \(N\) is such that C \- primepi\(C\) \= N, or A062298\(C\) \= N\. For a node with two children, the smaller child is assigned as the left child and the bigger one as the right child\. Otherwise, the child is assigned as the left child\.
