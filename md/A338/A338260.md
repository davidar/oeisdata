# a\(n\) is the number of nodes with depth of n in a binary tree defined as: root \= 1 and a child \(C\) of a node \(N\) is such that A337978\(C\) \= N\. For nodes with two children, the smaller child is assigned as the left child and the bigger one as the right child\. A child of a one\-child node is assigned as the left child\.
