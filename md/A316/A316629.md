# a\(n\) is the Sprague\-Grundy value of the Node\-Kayles game on the semi\-regular graph of n linked 4\-cycles with vertex set \{u\_1, u\_2, \.\.\., u\_n, u\_\{n\+1\}, v\_1, w\_1, v\_2, w\_2, \.\.\., v\_n, w\_n\}\. In this graph, u\_1, u\_2, \.\.\., u\_n, and u\_\{n\+1\} form a path, and additional edges are given by \{u\_i, v\_i\}, \{v\_i, w\_i\}, and \{w\_i, u\_\{i\+1\}\} for all i\=1,2,\.\.\.,n\.
