# Start with the list of positive integers L \= \{1, 2, 3, \.\.\.\} and set a\(1\) \= 1\. Then, for n \= 1, 2, 3, \.\.\., do the following: For each m in 1\.\.a\(n\), move the number k \= L\(n\+1\) to the right by k steps\. The number remaining immediately to the right of a\(n\) becomes a\(n\+1\)\.
