```Python
x = [1] # To count the number in the sequence
y = [1] # To record the sequence itself
N = 20 # The number of terms to calculate
while len(x) < N:
    x.append(x[-1] + 1)
    # The next number in the sequence will be divisible by x[-1] so start
    # looking at z which is the largest number divisible by x[-1] so far
    z = y[-1]//x[-1] * x[-1] + x[-1]
    # Now start counting up by x[-1] and check if the number is divisible by
    # every integer less than x[-1]

        z += x[-1]
